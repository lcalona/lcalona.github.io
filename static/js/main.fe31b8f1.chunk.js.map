Some\n      students will blindly take classes that fulfill their requirements without\n      accounting for the workload of each class, resulting in being overwhelmed\n      with assignments. Other students will ask their senior friends for\n      guidance and advice on which classes to take (or which to avoid), which\n      could help them avoid making a costly mistake. Then there are the students\n      that take matters into their own hands and research the different options\n      they have by using any resource available to them. There are many tools\n      available to aid students in their quest of choosing next quarter’s\n      classes. Some of the more popular ones include RateMyProfessor,\n      college-specific subreddits on Reddit, and college-provided tools such as\n      Course and Professor Evaluations (CAPEs) at UCSD. However, the information\n      students need to get a holistic picture of a specific class is often\n      fragmented across several platforms. This leads to students having to sift\n      through different sites and multiple tabs just to research one class.\n      Thus, trying to choose your schedule for the next quarter can often feel\n      just as overwhelming as completing classwork for the current quarter.\n    </p>\n  );\n\n  const overview = renderSection(\n    \"Overview\",\n    <p>\n      I completed this group project with two other students as part of an\n      Interaction Design class at UCSD. Through this project, I learned how to\n      apply the design process to find unmet needs, prototype possible\n      solutions, get feedback, and iterate to develop a useful mobile app.\n      SchoolProven is the result of this ten week sprint. This mobile web app\n      aims to provide students with an all-in-one platform to research their\n      upcoming classes with information and data they can trust. I was primarily\n      responsible for development, managing infrastructure for hosting the app,\n      deployment, and prioritization of new features.

We facilitated another three\n        users through a set of more detailed tasks and questions. We discovered\n        some general patterns:\n      </p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>\n          Common behavior includes users being able to easily navigate and use\n          the app. Most users noted how simple the app is, which allowed them to\n          easily find and use different functions.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          We also noticed that most users had trouble distinguishing between who\n          wrote which comment in review threads. They were also unsure where\n          they were at times after performing certain tasks. Most said this was\n          due to the lack of borders and feedback, respectively.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          Another common behavior we noticed was that users spent little time\n          digesting information that was presented to them, whether it was the\n          review writing options or profile information. What we heard was that\n          there was not a lot of motivation to do so.\n        </li>\n      </ul>\n      <p>\n        We updated the design of the Review and Q&A threads to make it clearer\n        who was replying to who. Additionally, we performed an A/B with a new\n        design on the Profile page to provide more motivation for users to visit\n        and interact with different user profiles. We called this feature\n        “Endorsements,” where users could endorse another user as being\n        “helpful” or “friendly.” We hypothesized that this would increase\n        interaction with the profile page, incentive users to read more reviews\n        more carefully, and also add another metric for users to gauge how\n        trustworthy or helpful a review is.\n      </p>\n    </>\n  );\n\n  const alternateDesigns = renderSection(\n    \"Alternate Designs\",\n    <>\n      <p>\n        We approached testing out alternate designs early on in the process\n        through the paper prototypes. For the first design (Paper Prototype #1),\n        we laid out the class page by placing the class info on top, a tab menu\n        to switch between Reviews and Q&A, and the relevant content (reviews or\n        questions) below. For the second design (Paper Prototype #2), the class\n        page was laid out in a similar manner with some slight changes; there\n        was a box containing statistics about the class (average grade, percent\n        recommending class, etc.) below the class information and the Q&A\n        section would be a separate page/component rather than being combined\n        with Reviews. Additionally, there were slight differences in how the\n        reviews were displayed. For the first design, we tried a three-tier\n        rating with “thumbs up”, “neutral”, and “thumbs down.” For the second\n        design, we used a traditional five-star rating. For the first design, we\n        had tags that displayed whether users found the review to be “helpful,”\n        “critical,” etc. We also focused more on the rating of the review in the\n        first design whereas we had more focus on the reviewer (displaying\n        major, year, etc.) in the second design.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Based on user testing, we ended up combining the best aspects of both\n        designs into our next iteration. We received feedback that the “thumbs\n        up”, “neutral”, and “thumbs down” system for rating reviews was slightly\n        confusing as we used a similar “thumbs up” and “thumbs down” system for\n        rating comments and answers to questions. Users wanted a more clear\n        distinction between the different actions, and also preferred the\n        granularity of the five-star method. Users enjoyed being able to quickly\n        see the class stats at a glance so we kept the class stats box. Users\n        also valued being able to quickly see what major and year the reviewer\n        was to be able to determine which reviews might be more relevant to\n        them. Finally, users appreciated having a combined Reviews and Q&A page\n        so that they can have all the information on a class in one place.\n      </p>\n      <Row>\n        <Col>\n          <Image\n            src={require(\"../img/SchoolProven/AlternateDesigns/AlternateDesign1.png\")}\n            fluid\n            rounded\n          />\n        </Col>\n        <Col>\n          <Image\n            src={require(\"../img/SchoolProven/AlternateDesigns/AlternateDesign2.png\")}\n            fluid\n            rounded\n          />\n        </Col>\n      </Row>\n    </>\n  );\n\n  const highFidelityPrototypes = renderSection(\n    \"High Fidelity Prototypes\",\n    renderCarousel([\n      require(\"../img/SchoolProven/HighFidelityPrototypes/Wireframe1.png\"),\n      require(\"../img/SchoolProven/HighFidelityPrototypes/Wireframe2.png\"),\n      require(\"../img/SchoolProven/HighFidelityPrototypes/Wireframe3.png\"),\n      require(\"../img/SchoolProven/HighFidelityPrototypes/Wireframe4.png\"),\n    ])\n  );\n\n  return (\n    <Container>\n      <GlobalNav />\n      <h1>SchoolProven</h1>\n      {/* <Image src={require(\"../img/SchoolProven/SchoolProven-Slide.png\")} fluid /> */}\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      {background}\n      <br />\n      {overview}\n      <br />\n      {problemStatement}\n      <br />\n      {userPersonas}\n      <br />\n      {competitiveAudit}\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      {storyboards}\n      <br />\n      {lowFidelityPrototypes}\n      <br />\n      {userTesting}\n      <br />\n      {alternateDesigns}\n      <br />\n      {highFidelityPrototypes}\n    </Container>\n  );\n}\n","import React from 'react';\nimport { Switch, Route } from 'react-router-dom';\n\nimport './App.css';\n\nimport Home from './components/Home';\nimport SchoolProven from './components/SchoolProven';\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <Switch>\n      <Route exact path=\"/\">\n        <Home />\n      </Route>\n      <Route path=\"/SchoolProven\">\n        <SchoolProven />\n      </Route>\n    </Switch>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n","import { useEffect } from \"react\";\nimport { useLocation } from \"react-router-dom\";\n\nexport default function ScrollToTop() {\n  const { pathname } = useLocation();\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    window.scrollTo(0, 0);\n  }, [pathname]);\n\n  return null;\n}","import React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\nimport { HashRouter } from \"react-router-dom\";\n\nimport './index.css';\nimport App from './App';\nimport ScrollToTop from './util/ScrollToTop';\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  <React.StrictMode>\n    <HashRouter basename=\"/\">\n      <ScrollToTop />\n      <App />\n    </HashRouter>\n  </React.StrictMode>,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n);\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
